## Terminology

### Rule declaration

A “rule declaration” is the name given to a selector (or a group of selectors) with an accompanying group of properties. Here's an example:

```css
.listing {
  font-size: 18px;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
```

### Selectors

In a rule declaration, “selectors” are the bits that determine which elements in the DOM tree will be styled by the defined properties. Selectors can match HTML elements, as well as an element's class, ID, or any of its attributes. Here are some examples of selectors:

```css
.my-element-class {
  /* ... */
}

[aria-hidden] {
  /* ... */
}
```

### Properties

Finally, properties are what give the selected elements of a rule declaration their style. Properties are key-value pairs, and a rule declaration can contain one or more property declarations. Property declarations look like this:

```css
/* some selector */ {
  background: #f1f1f1;
  color: #333;
}
```

## CSS

### Formatting

* Use soft tabs (2 spaces) for indentation
* Prefer dashes over camelCasing in class names.
  - Underscores and PascalCasing are okay if you are using BEM (see [OOCSS and BEM](#oocss-and-bem) below).
* Do not use ID selectors
* When using multiple selectors in a rule declaration, give each selector its own line.
* Put a space before the opening brace `{` in rule declarations
* In properties, put a space after, but not before, the `:` character.
* Put closing braces `}` of rule declarations on a new line
* Put blank lines between rule declarations

**Bad**

```css
.avatar{
    border-radius:50%;
    border:2px solid white; }
.no, .nope, .not_good {
    // ...
}
#lol-no {
  // ...
}
```

**Good**

```css
.avatar {
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid white;
}

.one,
.selector,
.per-line {
  // ...
}
```

### Comments

* Prefer line comments (`//` in Sass-land) to block comments.
* Prefer comments on their own line. Avoid end-of-line comments.
* Write detailed comments for code that isn't self-documenting:
  - Uses of z-index
  - Compatibility or browser-specific hacks

### CSS Modules

We encourage the use of CSS Modules for these reasons:

  * It helps create clear, strict relationships between CSS and Content
  * It helps us create reusable, composable components
  * It allows for less nesting and lower specificity
  * It helps in building scalable stylesheets
  
CSS Modules use webpack to inject the style code into the site. While this results in duplicating some CSS, it vastly improves the process of dealing with style management. Each component should have a CSS module specified with it, and only that module should refrence those styles. Global helper styles like padding and margin classes are can be access as such:

```jsx
import baseStyles from '_styles/index.css'
```

If multiple classes are needed, or styles should be applied conditionally, the classnames packaged should be used:

```jsx
// ListingCard.jsx
import cn from 'classnames'
import styles from './ListingCard.css'
...
  <div className={cn(styles.container, styles.card)}>
...
```

**Example**

```jsx
// ListingCard.jsx
import styles from './ListingCard.css';
const ListingCard = () => (
  <article className={styles.container ListingCard--featured">

    <h1 class="ListingCard__title">Adorable 2BR in the sunny Mission</h1>

    <div class="ListingCard__content">
      <p>Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper.</p>
    </div>

  </article>
)
```

```css
/* ListingCard.css */
.ListingCard { }
.ListingCardFeatured { }
.ListingCard__title { }
.ListingCard__content { }
```

  * `.ListingCard` is the “block” and represents the higher-level component
  * `.ListingCard__title` is an “element” and represents a descendant of `.ListingCard` that helps compose the block as a whole.
  * `.ListingCard--featured` is a “modifier” and represents a different state or variation on the `.ListingCard` block.

### ID selectors

While it is possible to select elements by ID in CSS, it should generally be considered an anti-pattern. ID selectors introduce an unnecessarily high level of [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) to your rule declarations, and they are not reusable.

For more on this subject, read [CSS Wizardry's article](http://csswizardry.com/2014/07/hacks-for-dealing-with-specificity/) on dealing with specificity.

### JavaScript hooks

Avoid binding to the same class in both your CSS and JavaScript. Conflating the two often leads to, at a minimum, time wasted during refactoring when a developer must cross-reference each class they are changing, and at its worst, developers being afraid to make changes for fear of breaking functionality.

We recommend creating JavaScript-specific classes to bind to, prefixed with `.js-`:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary js-request-to-book">Request to Book</button>
```

### Border

Use `none` instead of `0` to specify that a style has no border. This is more descriptive of the result.

**Bad**

```css
.foo {
  border: 0;
}
```

**Good**

```css
.foo {
  border: none;
}
```

## PostCSS

Our projects use a variety of PostCSS plugins to make writing CSS easier.

Here's a typical list:

* [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested)
* [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
* [postcss-simple-vars](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-simple-vars)
* [postcss-math](https://github.com/shauns/postcss-math)
* [postcss-color-functions](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-color-function)
* [postcss-flexbox-fixes](https://github.com/luisrudge/postcss-flexbugs-fixes)

### Syntax

### Ordering of property declarations

1. Property declarations

    List all standard property declarations, anything that isn't an `@include` or a nested selector.

    ```css
    .btn-green {
      background: green;
      font-weight: bold;
      // ...
    }
    ```

2. `@include` declarations

    Grouping `@include`s at the end makes it easier to read the entire selector.

    ```css
    .btn-green {
      background: green;
      font-weight: bold;
      @include transition(background 0.5s ease);
      // ...
    }
    ```

3. Nested selectors

    Nested selectors, _if necessary_, go last, and nothing goes after them. Add whitespace between your rule declarations and nested selectors, as well as between adjacent nested selectors. Apply the same guidelines as above to your nested selectors.

    ```css
    .btn {
      background: green;
      font-weight: bold;
      @include transition(background 0.5s ease);

      .icon {
        margin-right: 10px;
      }
    }
    ```

### Variables

Prefer camelCased variables over dash-cased of snaked_case variable names. This is because we are actually refrenceing a javascript variable inside our CSS file.

### Mixins

Mixins should be used to DRY up your code, add clarity, or abstract complexity--in much the same way as well-named functions. Mixins that accept no arguments can be useful for this, but note that if you are not compressing your payload (e.g. gzip), this may contribute to unnecessary code duplication in the resulting styles.

### Extend directive

`@extend` should be avoided because it has unintuitive and potentially dangerous behavior, especially when used with nested selectors. Even extending top-level placeholder selectors can cause problems if the order of selectors ends up changing later (e.g. if they are in other files and the order the files are loaded shifts). Gzipping should handle most of the savings you would have gained by using `@extend`, and you can DRY up your stylesheets nicely with mixins.

### Nested selectors

**Do not nest selectors more than three levels deep!**

```css
.page-container {
  .content {
    .profile {
      // STOP!
    }
  }
}
```

When selectors become this long, you're likely writing CSS that is:

* Strongly coupled to the HTML (fragile) *—OR—*
* Overly specific (powerful) *—OR—*
* Not reusable


Again: **never nest ID selectors!**

If you must use an ID selector in the first place (and you should really try not to), they should never be nested. If you find yourself doing this, you need to revisit your markup, or figure out why such strong specificity is needed. If you are writing well formed HTML and CSS, you should **never** need to do this.
