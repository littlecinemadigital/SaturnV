### Types
---------
  <a name="types--primitives"></a><a name="1.1"></a>
  - [1.1](#types--primitives) **Primitives**: When you access a primitive type you work directly on its value.

    - `string`
    - `number`
    - `boolean`
    - `null`
    - `undefined`
    - `symbol`

    ```javascript
    const foo = 1;
    let bar = foo;

    bar = 9;

    console.log(foo, bar); // => 1, 9
    ```

    - Symbols cannot be faithfully polyfilled, so they should not be used when targeting browsers/environments that don't support them natively.

  <a name="types--complex"></a><a name="1.2"></a>
  - [1.2](#types--complex)  **Complex**: When you access a complex type you work on a reference to its value.

    - `object`
    - `array`
    - `function`

    ```javascript
    const foo = [1, 2];
    const bar = foo;

    bar[0] = 9;

    console.log(foo[0], bar[0]); // => 9, 9
    ```
